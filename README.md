# LangGraph Examples

This repository contains various graph-based AI applications using the LangGraph library. LangGraph is a powerful Python library used for creating complex workflows and state machines.

## Contents

### 1. Basic Examples
- **Hello_World.ipynb**: A simple example introducing LangGraph and its basic concepts.
- **Sequential_Graph.ipynb**: Example of a sequential graph performing consecutive operations.
- **Conditional_Graph.ipynb**: Example of a graph with conditional branching.
- **Multiple_Inputs.ipynb**: Example of a graph that accepts multiple inputs.

### 2. Exercises
- **Exercise1.ipynb**: Basic LangGraph usage exercises.
- **Exercise2.ipynb**: Intermediate graph creation exercises.
- **Exercise3.ipynb**: Advanced applications and customizations.
