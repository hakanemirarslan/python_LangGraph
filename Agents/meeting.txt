Subject: Meeting Availability

Dear Tom,

I am writing to respectfully inform you that I will be unable to attend the meeting scheduled for 10:00 AM at Canary Wharf. I sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.

However, I would like to propose an alternative time and location that would be suitable for me. I am available to meet at 12:00 PM in Dortmund on the following day. Please let me know if this alternative is convenient for you.

Thank you for your understanding.

Sincerely,
Hakan
